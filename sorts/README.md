Sorting
===

My versions of soring algorithms:

*  Quick
*  Shell
*  Heap
*  Merge
*  Selection
*  Insertion

All sorting classes extend form AbstractSort class which has `sort(Comparable array[])` method for easier testing.
This method is redefined in all sorting classes.

TODO on next iteration
---

*  Try non-recursive methods for small parts of data in recursive methods
*  Try [Median-of-three partitioning](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/23quicksort/) in quick sorting
