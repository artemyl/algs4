# Dynamic connectivity
The problem is described [here](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/).  
This is my variant of weighted quick-union with and without path compression.  
Test file format is:  
*  first line has one integer value - number of pairs
*  next there are lines with pairs of integer values  
After my realization of Weighted quick union I've downloaded quick find class and tried it with the same test file (1kk elements), it worked ~250 times slower. Good motivation to learn algorithms.  
The experiment data file is [here](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/largeUF.txt).
